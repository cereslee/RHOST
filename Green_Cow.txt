Once upon a time there was a green cow named Marvin. Marvin liked to moo and sleep, but most of all he liked to eat grass. One day when going to the watering hole, Marvin looked into his reflection and saw that he had turned green!
Marvin had been green for a very long time, but he never paid much attention to the way he looked. Thinking he had just recently turned green, Marvin started to worry. "What if I have Mad Cow Disease?", he thought frantically.
